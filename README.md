# Dynamic Midpoint Binary Search ðŸš€

## Overview

This repository showcases an enhanced binary search algorithm that adjusts the midpoint based on the targetâ€™s relationship to the array boundaries (nums[l] and nums[r]). The goal is to optimize search performance by reducing unnecessary halving of the search space and short-circuiting the search when possible.

## Work in Progress

- **Benchmarking:** Developed comprehensive C benchmarking code (`benchmark_binary_search_large.c`) to compare the performance of the improved algorithm against the standard binary search across large datasets.
- **C Implementation:** Transitioned the improved algorithm from Python to C to leverage compiled language performance benefits.
- **Further Optimizations:** Exploring potential optimizations and alternative algorithms to enhance search efficiency.

## How It Works

1. **Check Boundary Conditions:**
   - If `target < nums[l]`, set `m = l`.
   - If `target > nums[r]`, set `m = r`.
   - Otherwise, use the standard midpoint `(l + r) / 2`.
2. **Compare and Adjust:**
   - Short-circuit searches by dynamically adjusting the midpoint based on the targetâ€™s position relative to `nums[m]`.
   - Continue adjusting until the target is found or the search space is exhausted.

## Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity:** \(O(\log n)\) in the worst case, similar to standard binary search.
- **Space Complexity:** \(O(1)\), utilizing in-place checks without additional data structures.

## Benchmark Results

### **Benchmark Setup**

- **Datasets:**
  - 100,000 elements
  - 1,000,000 elements
  - 10,000,000 elements
  - 50,000,000 elements
- **Iterations:** 100,000 searches per scenario
- **Target Distributions:**
  - **Uniform Random:** Evenly distributed targets across the entire range.
  - **High Out-of-Bounds:** 20% of targets are outside the array bounds.
  - **Clustered Near Boundaries:** Targets clustered near the start or end of the array.

### **Analysis**

- **Uniform Random Distribution:**
  - **All Dataset Sizes (100k, 1M, 10M, 50M):** Both **Improved** and **Standard Binary Searches** exhibit **identical or near-identical** performance, indicating no significant advantage in this distribution.

- **High Out-of-Bounds Distribution:**
  - **100k Elements:** The **Improved Binary Search** is **slower** (0.024s vs. 0.010s) than the **Standard Binary Search**.
  - **1M, 10M, 50M Elements:** The **Improved Binary Search** **outperforms** the **Standard Binary Search** (e.g., 0.010s vs. 0.011s at 1M elements), showcasing potential scalability benefits in handling out-of-bound targets.

- **Clustered Near Boundaries Distribution:**
  - **All Dataset Sizes:** The **Improved Binary Search** shows **marginal improvements** or performs **on par** with the **Standard Binary Search**, but the differences are not substantial enough to be considered significant.

**Conclusion:**

While the Improved Binary Search demonstrates marginal performance gains in certain scenariosâ€”particularly with high out-of-bounds targets in larger datasetsâ€”the benefits are not substantial enough to justify the added complexity in most cases. The Standard Binary Search remains highly efficient and simpler to implement, making it the preferred choice.

## Next Steps

- **Implement and Benchmark in C:** Continue refining the improved algorithm and explore its performance with larger datasets (e.g., 100 million elements).
- **Optimize the Improved Algorithm:** Reduce conditional branches, explore loop unrolling, and enhance cache locality.
- **Compare with C's `bsearch`:** Ensure fair benchmarking and investigate why `bsearch` underperforms, adjusting the benchmark if necessary.
- **Explore Alternative Implementations:** Consider using other programming languages or leveraging existing optimized libraries for better performance.
